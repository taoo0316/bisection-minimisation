The program takes in four arguments: the first derivative of the objective function, the lower bound, the upper bound and the error tolerance.

It returns the approximate solution x and number of iterations.

To run the program easily, you might want to check out the online Julia compiler and interpreter by [Replit](https://replit.com/new/julia).
